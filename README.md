  The_Second_Hand is an app which is a boon for students staying in college campus. We often see that students about to pass out of their college have things like cycles, or old books which they have to put in effort to sell off or end up just discarding them. On the other hand freshers have to buy new utilities while beginning their college life. To fill this demand-supply gap, The_Second_Hand plays an important role.Here, the students can add the item they don't need anymore and it will be visible on the app.Other students can see the those items and can contact the owner for direct negotiation to either buy or rent the item.
